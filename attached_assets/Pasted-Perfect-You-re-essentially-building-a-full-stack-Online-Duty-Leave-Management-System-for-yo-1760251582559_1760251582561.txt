Perfect 👍 You’re essentially building a **full-stack “Online Duty Leave Management System”** for your institute using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** with email notifications and role-based dashboards.

Here’s a **powerful and detailed prompt** you can use (for code generation, UI design, or documentation tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Vercel AI SDK):

## 🚀 **Prompt for Full-Stack Project Generation (Duty Leave Management System)**

**Title:**
Online Duty Leave Management System for Institute (MERN Stack)

**Tech Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React.js (JSX), Tailwind CSS / Material UI for professional UI
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
* **Authentication:** JWT / Passport.js
* **Email Notifications:** Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP or SendGrid)

---

### **📘 Project Description**

Build an **Online Duty Leave Management System** for a college/institute where students can apply for duty leave (DL) online and faculty members can approve/reject the applications.
The system should ensure:

* **Role-based access** for Students, Class Coordinators (CC), Heads of Department (HOD), and Vice Principal.
* **Attendance eligibility check:** Only students with attendance ≥75% can apply for DL (data stored in MongoDB).
* **Automatic routing and approval workflow** based on number of leave days.

---

### **🧩 Functional Requirements**

#### **Student Module**

* Student login/signup using institute email ID.
* Fill out **Duty Leave Form** with:

  * Name, Roll No, Department, Division, No. of Days, Purpose, and Date Range.
  * Option to **Add Another Student** in the same form (using “+ Add Student” button with dynamic input fields).
* **Validation:** Only students with attendance ≥75% (checked from database) can submit.
* Submit the form → Email notification automatically sent to respective approver(s).
* Track application status on dashboard (e.g., “Pending CC Approval”, “Approved by HOD”, “Rejected by CC”, etc.).
* View all past applications with status history.

#### **Faculty Module**

* Separate dashboards for:

  * **CC (Class Coordinator)** — Approve/Reject 1-day applications.
  * **HOD** — Approve/Reject 2-day applications.
  * **Vice Principal** — Approve/Reject more than 2-day applications.
* Each faculty receives an **email notification** when a DL request requiring their approval is submitted.

  * The email contains a **link** redirecting to the website’s login page.
* After login, faculty can view:

  * Pending Applications
  * Approved Applications
  * Rejected Applications
* Approve or reject requests with optional remarks.

### **📧 Email Workflow**

| No. of DL Days | Approver(s)               | Email Triggered To |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 1              | Class Coordinator         | CC Email           |
| 2              | CC + HOD                  | Both emails        |
| >2             | CC + HOD + Vice Principal | All three emails   |

* Email Subject: “New Duty Leave Application - [Student Name]”
* Body: Includes student details, number of days, and link to dashboard.

---

### **🖥️ UI / UX Requirements**

* **Modern Institute Theme:** Blue and white color palette, rounded cards, responsive design.
* Use **Tailwind CSS** or **Material UI** components.
* **Navbar:** Logo + Navigation (Home, Apply, Status, Dashboard, Logout).
* **Dashboard Cards:** Pending, Approved, Rejected counts.
* **Loading & Toast Notifications:** SweetAlert or React-Toastify for success/error.
* Use **React Router** for navigation.

### **🗂️ Database Design (MongoDB Collections)**

**Students Collection:**

```js
{
  name: String,
  rollNo: String,
  department: String,
  division: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  attendancePercentage: Number
}
```

**Faculty Collection:**

```js
{
  name: String,
  role: String, // 'CC', 'HOD', 'VicePrincipal'
  department: String,
  email: String,
  password: String
}
```

**DLApplications Collection:**

```js
{
  applicant: ObjectId, // Student ID
  addedStudents: [String], // Additional names
  department: String,
  division: String,
  numberOfDays: Number,
  reason: String,
  dateFrom: Date,
  dateTo: Date,
  approvals: {
    cc: { status: String, date: Date },
    hod: { status: String, date: Date },
    vp: { status: String, date: Date }
  },
  overallStatus: String, // Pending, Approved, Rejected
  createdAt: Date
}
```

---

### **🔒 Authentication & Authorization**

* **JWT tokens** for secure API communication.
* Role-based routing in frontend:

  * `/student/dashboard`
  * `/faculty/dashboard`
  * `/login`
  * `/apply-dl`

---

### **🛠️ Extra Features (Optional Enhancements)**

* **PDF generation:** Download approved DL application as a PDF.
* **Analytics for Admin:** Number of DL requests per month, approval rates, etc.
* **Dark/Light mode toggle.**
* **Search and filter** applications by date, department, or status.

### **🧠 Example Folder Structure**

```
/client
  /src
    /components
    /pages
    /context
    /utils
/server
  /models
  /routes
  /controllers
  /middleware
  server.js
```

---

### **🧾 Example User Flow**

1. Student logs in → fills DL form → submits.
2. System checks attendance ≥75%.
3. System determines approvers (CC, HOD, VP) based on number of days.
4. Email notifications sent.
5. Faculty logs in → sees pending requests → approves/rejects.
6. Student dashboard updates real-time (pending → approved/rejected).
7. Student can view status history.

### **✨ My Suggestions (Extra Touches)**

✅ Add **timeline-style progress tracker** on student dashboard (Pending → CC Approved → HOD Approved → Final).
✅ Add **profile picture + institute logo** on all pages.
✅ Use **Framer Motion animations** for page transitions.
✅ Add **auto-refreshing dashboard** using sockets (optional).
✅ Include **footer** with institute details, social links, and copyright.

Would you like me to generate a **complete folder structure + sample code (backend APIs + React components + email flow)** for this prompt next?
That would give you a ready-to-run starter project.
